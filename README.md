The Chrome dinossaur, but 3D.

# 🔨 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Latest verison of Unity (can be downloaded from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)). This game was made using Unity 2021.3.20f1 LTS.
- The game was tested only on Windows. But one should be able to port it to other platforms too.

### New Project

Clone the repository using Git or downloading it. Open with the same version of Unity as the project was made (or recent). Do your stuff!

# 💲 Credits, cuz some people need to pay their bills.

And last but not least, I got the idea to start the project because of this YouTube video: [Needlessly 3D Chrome Dinosaur Game (JavaScript/Three.js)](https://youtu.be/KJ38qCwFdy8). Go check him out!
